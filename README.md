# ðŸ“Š Task 2 - Superstore Profit Dashboard

## âœ… Objective:
The goal of this task was to practice **Data Visualization and Storytelling** using a real-world sales dataset. I used the **Superstore** dataset to create a visual dashboard that conveys key business insights clearly and effectively.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Superstore.csv** dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Key Visualizations:
- **Profit by Sub-Category**: Identifies top and bottom-performing product types (e.g., Chairs and Phones are most profitable).
- **Profit by Category**: Visualizes contribution of each category (Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies).
- **Profit by Segment**: Shows how Corporate, Consumer, and Home Office segments impact profit.
- **Profit by State**: Interactive slicer to filter visuals by individual U.S. states.
- **Sales, Profit & Quantity KPIs**: Summarized at the top for a quick performance snapshot.

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights:
- **Furniture** category yields the highest profit overall.
- **Chairs and Phones** are leading sub-categories in terms of profitability.
- **Home Office segment** drives the largest share of profits.
- The dashboard allows dynamic filtering by state to explore regional performance.
